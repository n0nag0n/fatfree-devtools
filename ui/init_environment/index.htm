<h1 class="my-4">Welcome to the Fat-Free DevTools Setup!</h1>

<p>Fat-Free Framework is a loosely opinionated framework for PHP. You can configure your project in an unlimited amount of possibilities because of how simple the framework is itself.</p>

<p>Take the below code for example:</p>

<pre><code class="lang-php">&lt;?php

require 'vendor/autoload.php';

$f3 = \Base::instance();
$f3->route('GET /', function() {
	echo 'Hello, world!';
});
$f3->run();
</code></pre>

<p>The above code is complete to render the root route (<code>/</code>) to echo out a text response. Pretty simple. But the more complex your application becomes, the more difficult it is to manage all its parts.</p>

<p>The goal of Fat-Free DevTools is to help create projects in a slightly more opinionated manner. <b>YOU DO NOT HAVE TO FOLLOW EVERYTHING IN THIS SETUP FOR YOUR PROJECT!</b> You can simple start your project if you want, and then create your own controllers, routes, config files, whatever you want!</p>

<p>With all this said, let's go ahead and get the environment setup.</p>
